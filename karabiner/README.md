This contains an XML file for [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) which remaps the keys to match the keycap layout.

For this to work, DIP switches 1 and 6 should be on and the rest off on your WASD v2 keyboard.

The media keys are the default. The function keys (F1-F15) are accessible via Fn key.

This replaces the private.xml located in ~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner
